# Return Types

A return type indicates what data type the method will return

`public <return_type> methodName() {...}`

The `void` return typ eis used when a method doesn't return anything

if a method specifies a return type other than void, it must return that type of data.

No need to use return if the return type is void.

Use `return` to exit a method early.
